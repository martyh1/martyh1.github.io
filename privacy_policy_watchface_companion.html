Privacy Policy for Digi Time Watchface Companion

I, Marty Hammel, built the Digi Time Watchface Companion app as a companion app for the Digi Time Watchface. It provides instructions only on installation of the separate Watchface for sale on the Google Play store. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who chooses to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. I do not collect or store any personally identifiable information through the watch face itself. Any data collected by third-party services (if used) is governed by their respective privacy policies.
